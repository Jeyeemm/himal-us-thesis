HELLO!

This capstone project is a way of helping preserve and showcase the culture and tradition of the island of Guimaras in the Philippines. 

By utilizing a legend that has been approved by ourlocal historian, we made a multimedia comic that presents the story in a creative and immersive way for our viewers.

ACCESSIBILITY

We the researchers believe that giving public access is necesarry in order to spread information, which is why we built a custom website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is available anytime and anywhere to enter as long as the user has internet access. 

This directory contains the graphics, animations, audio, and code used for the option of running the website OFFLINE. Once downloaded and extracted, simply run the html file in the "src" folder.

MOTIVATION

The island of Guiamras at our current time (2020-2024) has a limtied number of published works pertaining its culutre, denizens, and history. This has pushed our group to conduct a study not only for publishing, but to help attract enthusiasts, students, and the curious. Using our skills in creating multimedia, our team created an immersive and inforrmative capstone project.
